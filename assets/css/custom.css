/* 
    Custom CSS Stylesheet (custom.css)

    This file is intended for adding additional custom styles
    and overriding existing styles from the main.css file.
    
    Please follow these guidelines:
    
    1. Only add new styles or override existing ones when necessary.
    2. When overriding styles, use more specific selectors or !important where justified.
    3. For better readability and maintainability, group rules by component/module.
    4. Always test changes across all target devices and screen sizes.
    5. Aim to maintain structure and consistency with the overall project style.

    Thank you for adhering to the standards and paying attention to detail!
